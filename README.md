## THIS PACKAGE IS DEAD.

If you are looking for a DataTables package with automatic serverside publishing for Meteor, use this one instead:

[here](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-tabular)

```bash
$ meteor add aldeed:tabular
```

## About the aldeed:tabular package:

Although this appears similar to the jquery-datatables Meteor package, there are actually many differences:

This package is updated to work with Meteor 1.0+.
This package has a much smaller codebase and includes less of the DataTables library.
This package allows you to specify a Spacebars template as a cell's content.
This package handles the reactive table updates in a different way.
This package is designed to work with Twitter Bootstrap 3
